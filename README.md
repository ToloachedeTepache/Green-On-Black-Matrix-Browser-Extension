# Green-On-Black-Matrix-Browser-Extension
 Renders everything green-on-black, line-by-line, from top to bottom. Like a terminal from The Matrix movie. I loved the part where they go "It's hackin'time"
 Hello!!!!
 This code was supposed to play the noise of a dot matrix printer while it rendered the text but i'm unable to make it work. So, if anyone is willing to modify the code 
 to make it so that'd be fantastic.
